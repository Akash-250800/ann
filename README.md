## Project Overview

This project aims to solve two tasks:
1. **Customer Churn Classification**: Predict whether a customer is likely to churn (classification task).
2. **Estimated Salary Prediction**: Predict a customer's estimated salary (regression task).
  
Additionally, hyper-parameter tuning is applied to optimize the ANNâ€™s performance for both tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of the following features:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, Gender, Geography
- **Account Information**: Balance, Tenure, Number of Products, Estimated Salary
- **Customer Status**: Whether the customer churned (1: Yes, 0: No)

## Model Architecture

The model consists of two parts:
1. **Churn Classification Branch**:
   - **Input Layer**: Takes demographic and account information.
   - **Hidden Layers**: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
   - **Output Layer**: Sigmoid activation for binary classification (churn or not).
   - **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy.

2. **Estimated Salary Regression Branch**:
   - **Input Layer**: Same input features as the churn classification branch.
   - **Hidden Layers**: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activation.
   - **Output Layer**: A single neuron for salary prediction.
   - **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).

The model shares some layers for both tasks but branches out after a certain depth for task-specific output.

## Hyper-Parameter Tuning

Hyper-parameter tuning is used to find the best combination of parameters such as:
- **Number of hidden layers**
- **Number of neurons in each layer**
- **Learning rate**
- **Batch size**
- **Epochs**

Tuning is performed using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search, optimizing both the classification and regression objectives.
